                                                      REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY
INTRODUCTION:

The term remote keyless system (RKS), also called keyless entry or remote central locking, refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a
handheld device or automatically by proximity. 
Widely used in automobiles, an RKS performs the functions of a standard car key without physical contact. When within a few yards of the car, pressing a button on the remote can
lock or unlock the doors, and may perform other functions. 
Remote Keyless Entry Systems (RKES) are also known to have weaknesses. The systems usually have relatively simple functionality: Open/Close and sometimes a function to find the
car or unlock the trunk. The remotes are usually working on the 315MHz, 433MHz and 868 MHz radio bands, which are free to use. Many of the RKES are unidirectional, but some are
also bidirectional allowing for challenge-response authentication. The unidirectional RKES nowadays usually features a rolling code. A rolling code is calculated on both the
receiver (car) and the transmitter (key) and if there is a match of a received signal, the car will open/close. This way, the  transmission  is different  every time, eliminating
a simple replay attack. 

SWOT ANALYSIS:

 Strength:
 
Thieves are always a concern for property owners. Security measures must be taken to protect any valuables, including your car. Keys donâ€™t provide the added protection that a keyless entry system would. With the press of a button on the keychain, car owners can lock/unlock their vehicle, trunk, and sometimes their engines. 

Weakness:

 A power failure can cause some issues with keyless systems. You never know when technology will fail .
 
 Cost can be prohibitive.
 
Opportunities:

The RKE system has a lot of potential in automobiles since it can be configured to protect cars from panics, such as noise, as well as car theft, by adding new features like 
alarms.

Threats:

  RKE System introduces many threats such as relay, relay attack ,Key fob cloning and so on.
  
5Ws& 1H:

WHO: Who wants to control the actions of car remotely.

WHEN: Controlling locks.

WHY: Better security & action controlled by remotely.

WHERE: Used from anywhere using remote.

WHAT: It can be locking & unlocking vehicle door.

How: When a button is pushed, it sends a coded signal by radio waves to a receiver unit in the car, which locks or unlocks the door.
